/*
1. std::max, std::min
if you want to compare two variable(std::max(a, b)), just include <iostream>
but if you want to comapre more than two variables(std::max({a, b, c, ...})), you have to include <algorithm>

2. Memoization
storing the results of function calls and returning the cashed result when the same inputs occur again 
purpose : to speed up function calls (to optimizate the time complexity of DP algorithm)
